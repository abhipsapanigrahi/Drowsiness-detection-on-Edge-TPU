# Drowsiness-detection-on-Edge-TPU

## This is an implementation of a drowsiness detection algorithm implemented using python programming language on a coral edge TPU.

## Here, we have used transfer learning in Mobile Net , which is a CNN architecture. OpenCV image proessing library is also used in this project.
## The Raspberry Pi camera is used to capture the video if the subject.
## The video output is analysed to give the detected results in real time.
