# Drowsiness-detection-on-Edge-TPU

This is an implementation of a drowsiness detection algorithm implemented using python programming language on a coral edge TPU. Here, we have used MobileNet_v2, which is a CNN architecture. OpenCV image proessing library is also used in this project. Raspberry Pi camera is used to capture the videostream.
The video output is analysed to give the detected results in real time.
